# dbc-repos

### Clone all repos from your cohort's organization, along with all the branches!

1. Don't clone this repo - instead, download the files and save locally. Otherwise you'll have repos inside a repo, no-no.
2. `getAllBranches.sh` and `download-repos.rb` should be in the same directory.
3. Change the organization name on line 23 of `download-repos.rb`.
4. Run `gem install octokit`.
5. Run `ruby download-repos.rb`.
